My program should be working on all the requirements. 

Achieved Bells and Whistles:

3 points: randomly determine the number of rows and columns
5 points: Animate your tiles: When you click on a tile, instead of moving it, figure out how to get your tiles to animate to their desired location.
N points: Personalized CSS
(3 points) Add variety by using different images in your puzzle: Make your puzzle out of a variable number of images and randomly pick an image to show in your sliding puzzle.

I used mozilla, W3School and office hour to do this project.
Estimated time spent on this project: 15 hours.
